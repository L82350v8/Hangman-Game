# Hangman-Game
This project was developed by a student learning the javaScript programming language.  
Creating this game gave the developer experience with coding javaScript in an interesting way.
This project is useful because it combines many javaScript concepts in practical ways. 
The game is also interesting to play. 

The Hangman game is played by: 
1. Pressing any key to start a game. 
2. The player is presented with a Current Word that has all of it's letters masked with underscores.
   The theme of this game is related to Muscle Cars of the 1960s. This means all of the words used in the game will relate to the name of a muscle car that was produced in the 1960s.  
3. The objective is for the player to guess all of the letters for the Current Word within 10 attempts. 
4. If the player does not guess all of the letters of the word within 10 tries, the player loses the game. 
5. If the player guesses all of the letters of the word within 10 tries, the player wins the game.  
6. The game keeps track of the number of games won and lost as subsequent games are played. 

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
